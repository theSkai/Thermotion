# Thermotion

This is the supplementary repository for 'Thermotion: Design and Fabrication of Thermofluidic Composites for Animation Effects on Object Surfaces' paper (ACM CHI2023). 
The work studies the mechanism, design space, and the design and fabrication workflow of Themotion composites, which utilize thermofluidic flows in fluidic channels embedded under the object surfaces, dynamically controlling the surface temperature as an actuator for thermochromic animation effects. 

Here we provide the instructions on installation and usage of Thermotion Design Tool, source code for secondary development, and 3D-printing models of most examples we used in the research for replication.
